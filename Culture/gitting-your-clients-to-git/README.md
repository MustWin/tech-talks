Title: Gitting your Clients to Git. Making organizations Transparent via
Git

Speaker: Gonzalo

Summary: Many of our clients come to us wanting to improve their
Engineering Teams throughput & code quality. In our experience the best
way to fix those issues is to make teams more transparent, and we
believe Github is one of the best tools for achieving that.

This talk will show how you can use Pull Requests & Github Issues for almost
anything in your organization and how that will help making your
workplace a better and healthier place to work.

A couple examples:
* How to use a Pull Request to change an Office Policy
* How to use Github to keep track of usability Issues
* How Github Issues & Pull Requests help managers understand how much "Work In Progress"
  the engineering team can handle
* How to share and collaborate on Tech Talk Proposals (So Meta!)
