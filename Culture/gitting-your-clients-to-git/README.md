Abstract:
Many of our clients come to us asking for help on improving their Engineering Teams throughput & code quality. In our experience the best way to fix those issues is to make teams more transparent, in this talk we'll show how to achieve
this using a platform you know and love: GitHub.

This talk will show how you can use Pull Requests & Github Issues for almost
anything in your organization and show how this collaborative worklfow will make your
workplace a better and healthier place to work.

Details: 

This talk will go over real stories where we:
* Used Git Logs to Reverse Engineer the real Engineering Org Structure (Conway would be proud)
* Used a Pull Request to change an Office Policy
* Used PR to fix the UI of a MVP
* Made "managment" understand how much "Work In Progress" an engineering team can handle using with Github Issues & Pull Requests 
* Used Github to share and collaborate on Tech Talk Proposals (So Meta!)

Pitch:
* This talk will empower Engineers to go beyond just debugging code, but also starting to debug their own Organizations and Workflows
* It will show how powerful READMEs can be, and how to leverage them to change whole organizations
